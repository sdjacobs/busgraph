In this example, a directed graph of selected cities in the US is superimposed on a map of
the US. Click a city to run Dijktra's algorithm from that city.

The data comes from [Infoplease](http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0004592.html), although I manually
picked which cities had direct connections, for the purposes of showing the algorithm. Map imagery
is (c) Open Street Map and Mapbox.

This builds on my [d3-mapzoom](http://bl.ocks.org/sdjacobs/9ce5fadce234497dc592) plugin, as well as
my [Dijkstra](http://bl.ocks.org/sdjacobs/3900867adc06c7680d48) implementation.
